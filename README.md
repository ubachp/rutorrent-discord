# rutorrent-discord
A rutorrent plugin for discord webhook notifications (https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook)

Sends messages directly into a discord channel with configurable parameters:

And if discord is properly set up, displays desktop notifications the moment a torrent is added, deleted or finished:
